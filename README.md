Data Structure using Java


## Searching

* Linear Search  O(n)

we can use it to search element in any sorted as well as un-sorted collection.
If collection contains less no. of elements, then linear search is efficient.

* Binary Search  O(logn)

To overcome limitation of linear search, use binary search.
We can use binary search on sorted collection/ array ONLY.
Binary search is based on divide & conquer technique.

## Sorting

* Selection Sort  O(n2)
* Bubble Sort  O(n2)
* Insertion sort  O(n2)

* Quick Sort  O(n2)
* Merge Sort  O(nlogn)
